            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO enquire into the History and Original of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Law, may seem an Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king far too Adventurous, since the best of our ancient Lawyers are pleas'd to declare, that <hi>Her Foundations are not known:</hi> That we know not where to look for her Tracings; forasmuch as the most Primitive <hi>British</hi> Laws, the Fountain of all that follow'd, were elder than even the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Letters in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Of this kind we are taught to believe our old Common Law
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:94637:4"/> to be: For<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. 1. cap. 1.</note>
               <hi>Bracton</hi> calls it <hi>Jus non Scriptum,</hi> and<note n="(b)" place="bottom">In Prooem.</note>
               <hi>Fleta</hi> (who copies him pretty exactly) <hi>Leges non Scriptae.</hi> These Laws<note n="(c)" place="bottom">De laud, Leg. Angl. cap. 17.</note> Sir <hi>John Fortescue</hi> says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly were never alter'd by the <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</hi> or <hi>Normans;</hi> who all found 'em so agreeable to the first Rules and Dictates of Right and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Reason, that they were sensible they had none better to establish in their stead. This Doctrine looks Venerable; and therefore some of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Long Robe have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept at a decent distance from it. It has been their Mode to place any old Term or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, whereof they meet not
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:94637:4"/> with the Original in the printed Statutes, Register or Year-Books, under the Head and Title of the<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>H. Spelm.</hi> Gloss. voc. <hi>Englecheria.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Common-Law;</hi> and this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedes all farther Enquiry into its Parentage and Pedigree, as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually as if (<hi>Hero</hi>-like) it were descended from <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Rep. par. 3. in Prooem.</note> says, the Name of <hi>Common Law</hi> was first gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, to a Collection which he made out of all the Laws of his Ancestors. But I leave it to our more modern Professors, whether that King's Ordinances (as they are publish'd by <hi>Lambard</hi>) can justly challenge any such Denomination. These were indeed confirm'd by <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the Conqueror, at the<note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>M. Paris,</hi> ad An. 1070.</note>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:94637:5"/> earnest Suit of the <hi>English;</hi> but qualify'd with the Addition of many <hi>(Norman)</hi> Feudal Services and Tenures. To say that any of these are of an Eternal and Immutable Nature, is to make them Divine, and not Humane. So that tho some particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are by all Nations borrow'd from the common and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principles of Reason, which is a part of God's own Law, yet the Body of each Countrey's Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Constitutions was ever subject to the same Changes and Alterations with the State it self; and a diligently exact observance of these, will always furnish us with the best and most useful part of its History.</p>
            <p>To this good End, I cannot but hope that the Study of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Laws will shortly grow more
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:94637:5"/> fashionable in our Universities: Where (as all other kinds of good Literature, so especially) the Knowledge of our <hi>British</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities begins to flourish in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Perfection than formerly. The only Reason that one of our Old<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Sir <hi>J. Fortesc.</hi> de Laud. Leg. cap. 48.</note> Lawyers could give his Prince, why our Academicks in his Days were unacquainted with the Laws of the Land, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were strangers to the Tongue wherein a great many of 'em were penn'd: But that Obstacle is sufficiently remov'd, since (as an Excellent Person has modestly noted in his own Case) the <hi>French</hi> Language is now so <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common among us, that it is not thought a Part of Learning to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:94637:6"/> it.</hi> The local Statutes oblige the Scholars at <hi>Cambridge</hi> to be<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. J. <hi>Cowel,</hi> in Praefat. ad Instit. Leg. Angl.</note> conversant in the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Laws of their Native Countrey; and this good Reason is assign'd for the Injunction, <hi>ut differentias Exteri Patrii{que} Juris sic cognoscant,</hi> that they may see how far <hi>England</hi> excells other Nations in the wisdom of their Composure. Surely the <hi>Ratio Legis,</hi> in this particular, will hold as strong at <hi>Oxford.</hi> From such Students we are to hope for a Regular History of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Progress of our <hi>English</hi> Laws; a work, which (to our great dishonour) is still wanting in this Kingdom; Since the Men of chief Learning and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:94637:6"/> in our Inns of Court are not at leisure for such Enquiries, the whole of their time being employ'd in (what is more Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the ordinary Duties of their Calling) the Practical Part of their Profession, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the Causes of their Clients. This defect had been long since amply supply'd, had the Project of those Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (who, in the beginning of this Age, had form'd themselves into a Society of Antiquaries) met with a suitable Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their first subject, propos'd to be treated on and consider'd, being<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. D. <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> in Vit. D. <hi>Rob. Cotton,</hi> pag. 9.</note>
               <hi>De Antiquitate Legum Angliae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How necessary the Study and
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:94637:7"/> Knowledge of our Laws and Law-Books are to compleat the Historian, has been observ'd by the great<note n="(a)" place="bottom">D. <hi>Ed. Coke,</hi> Instit. Par. 2. p. 498, 499.</note> Oracle of those Laws; who takes notice that the most Learned Men of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, for want of skill in Legal Antiquities, have been grossly mistaken in treating of these matters. He instances in <hi>Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> who both main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Justices-Itinerant were first Instituted by <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and laid aside by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; in both which Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars they were out: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he advises that when our Historians meddle with matters of Law, they would consult those that are knowing in them.
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:94637:7"/> I think, 'twould be as adviseable for the Man that attempts the Writing of our History to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be so much Master of the Law, as to be his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour and Guide. How many scandalous mistakes was <hi>Polydor Vergil</hi> guilty of, meerly for want of skill in the History of our <hi>English</hi> Laws? Mistakes, which (if there had been no other fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it) were sufficient for ever to discredit his Book. Had he been Master of that Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we are now wishing for in him that pretends to write the Story of this Kingdom, he could never have asserted, that <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the Sheriff's Office, and brought in Tryals by a Jury of twelve Men; that <hi>Henry</hi> the First was the Contriver of the
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:94637:8"/> Aid (which our Law-Books call <hi>à file marrier</hi>) for Augmentation of the King's Daughter's Dowry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not to mention his Errours relating to the common Usage and Customes of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Inferiour Courts of Judicature, which are innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, the Reader may tell me, that even the Account which he meets with in some of the following Chapters (about the Institution and Modern proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of these Courts) are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a little too Lame and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactory: But he ought to consider that 'tis not my Business to Write a History, but to give what directions I could for the doing of that hereafter. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to touch no farther upon these matters, than what will just
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:94637:8"/> serve for an Introduction or Step to (what is chiefly intended) the Pointing at such latent Records as may be for my Historian's purpose: So that, if the main Building proves good and firm, I am not much concern'd how Stately and Strong, or how Slight and Pitiful, my Scaffolding may be.</p>
            <p>Neither ought it to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me, that every little Pamphleteer that has occasionally Written on any single Point of Law, and only repeated what has been a Hundred times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by better Authors, should be taken Notice of. 'Tis enough to say, I have chiefly concern'd my self with Writers of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient standing and good Repute. Some others I may mention, that do not deserve either of those
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:94637:9"/> Characters: But I have designed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted many that I knew to be Triflers, and several that I suspected to be so. There are Books which may be very good in their kind, and serviceable to one design'd for the Profession of the Law, which I did not think so necessary a Part of our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian's Library; and therefore the Reader will in vain expect to meet with them in the following Treatise: Such as Sir <hi>John Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deridge</hi>'s English Lawyer, <hi>H. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi>'s Preparative, and <hi>W. Philip</hi>'s Directions for that Study; all which have excellently well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd those Qualifications that are requisite in the Professors of our Law, and prescrib'd the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods most proper for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of their Knowledge in it, but do not seem to carry in
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:94637:9"/> them, what so nearly concerns the Subject under our present Consideration, or what will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly fall within any of the ensueing Chapters. Tables of Fees, Books of Precedents for Attourneys and their Clerks, &amp;c. I thought not worth my Notice; as useless and foreign to History. It's more than probable that I am mistaken in omitting many Authors and Books that have very well deserv'd to be mention'd; and that, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, I have noted down o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are Trivial, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the Rank I have given them amongst Writers of a better Fashion and Quality. They that think this Work fit to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, will (I hope) be so kind as to inform me of what faults they observe of either sort; and
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:94637:10"/> they shall be very gratefully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, if God continues my Life and Health till I can bring this imperfect Attempt to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that looks more complete than a bare Essay. I do confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hope that the Book will prove serviceable to a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gentlemen, whose studies and acquaintance in the Laws of this Kingdom have enabled them to make large Additions to what I here present them with: And, if my Endeavours to serve them have merited it, I do not doubt but they will kindly let me know what is wanting, and how it may be supply'd. I shall gratefully acknowledge any such obliging Information.</p>
            <p>I have not here (as in the two foregoing Parts) always noted the Time and Place of various
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:94637:10"/> Editions. The Books that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are generally Printed at <hi>London,</hi> where our Inns of Court are: And the several Editions, of those that are reprinted, do commonly agree in the Main. Where there are any considerable Variations, I have (to the best of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) noted down the Years wherein the most correct Copies were publish'd: Otherwise, I have contented my self with marking the size of the Book, and its Price, as the <hi>Term-Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi> (and those by <hi>Clavel</hi> and <hi>Basset</hi>) have given them. I may, I think, avow that I have read most of the Ancient Writers; and the Censures I give of them are what I believe to be honest and fair. In those that are modern, I have sometimes ventur'd wholly to
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:94637:11"/> rely upon the Judgment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and have very frequently given only the bare Titles of such as I had no opportunity of knowing any farther or better. I must here observe (what I am sorry and loath to do) that, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally speaking, the Oldest Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Law-Books are the best: Whether it be that the Gentlemen of that Profession do not love to trouble themselves with the Niceties of exact Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thography and Criticism, or that the ready Sale of such Works causes the Press to teem them out a little too hastily, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>Most of what is here offer'd to public view and censure had been printed some Months ago, had not the Author been prevail'd with to add a Chapter (more
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:94637:11"/> than was intended) concerning our <hi>English</hi> Coins: And he hopes that what is said on that Subject will attone for all the delay he has made. It was thought a little hard that so many Authors should have written whole Volumes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, and not so much as one of our own Antiquaries should ever think it worth his while to treat on those of this Nation; that <hi>Strada</hi> and others should be able to preserve the true Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Emperors, taken from their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and Money, and yet none attempt to do the like Service for our <hi>English</hi> Kings; that there should be <hi>La France Metallique,</hi> and that <hi>Spain</hi> should have her <hi>Museo de las Medallas,</hi> and yet <hi>England</hi> not have so much as a
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:94637:12"/> Man that (till Worthy Mr. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi> bravely shew'd the way) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to cultivate this Branch of her Antiquities. The general Complaint was, That our antient Money was so inar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially coin'd, that hardly a Piece was to be found that gave a King's Face with any tolerable Exactness; and that this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd that Confusion, when we came to enquire after several Kings of the same Name, as was indeed extremely discouraging, if not insuperable. I dare not pretend to have wholly remov'd this Difficulty; and yet I think I may boldly affirm that I have (in some measure) lessen'd it, and given a fair Invitation to the Skillful Reader to try his better Strength upon it. I have given some sort of Account or other of
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:94637:12"/> all the Coins (whether in Gold or Silver) which, as far as I could learn, were minted in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, and before the Union of the two Crowns in King <hi>James</hi> the First: And this has swell'd that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at such a rate that I was forced to lop off a few less necessary Branches in others, to preserve this Third Part from being of too over-grown a Bulk for its Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. It will readily be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that here I have had the best Assistance that the Kingdom could afford me, and therefore it must be my <hi>Fault</hi> if I have not set Matters in as good a Light as they would admit of: Whereas, if in the other Chapters (where I walk single, and without a Guide) I chance sometimes to mistake my way, I am the more excusable.</p>
            <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:94637:13"/>
            <p>Before this was finish'd, I was desir'd to bethink my self of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Addition; of a few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Rules for the Judging at the Age of our ancient Manuscript Instruments and Records. The Limits, to which I am at present confin'd, will not suffer me to look any farther back than the Middle of the Eleventh Century; and, even for such a Period, I cannot say that my Circumstances would have afforded me Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als enough for a compleat Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on this Subject. By what I have of that kind, I see 'twould be no easy Task to give certain Directions for the distinguishing the Ages of Deeds and Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, purely by the Hand and Character. I have several Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Instruments, both of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:94637:13"/> wherein the Cotemporary Scribes write as variously as we do now; and it would be hard to assign this or the other as a Standard for their common <hi>Aera.</hi> I will not deny but some Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms there are in this Art (such as that about the many ways of writing the Letter <hi>i,</hi> befors it came to be pointed, as 'tis now, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which are well to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but, I dare say, there are not many in Father <hi>Mabillon</hi>'s whole Treasury, that will universally hold within the Times here trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on. Whilst Learning and Letters were in a few hands, the Modes of Writing were pretty Uniform: But, as Writers grew Numberless, the Alphabets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd in proportion, and the Degrees of Painters and Penmen were infinite. The surest way
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:94637:14"/> of Judging of the Age of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grants is by their Forms, Witnesses, and Seals; whereof the Reader will find some Account in the following Sheets. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and <hi>Chancery-Acts</hi> are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been always written in a Hand different from that of the Ordinary Dispatches of Private Men: So that the History of these will not create so great a Trouble to a Student in our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Antiquities, and 'tis hoped there will be no want of Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on this Head. If the Seventh Chapter be not sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive in the rest, I have good Encouragement to believe that the Defect will shortly be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by Mr. <hi>Wanley;</hi> who has already given his Friends a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Specimen</hi> of his Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Qualifications for such a
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:94637:14"/> Work, by his Exact Imitation of some old Manuscripts in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> and King's Libraries. These Copies, with others that he has taken in <hi>Oxford,</hi> he designs for the Foundation of a <hi>Res Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plomatica</hi> for <hi>England:</hi> Which, we may justly hope, will enable us (at the first view) to ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Age of any tatter'd Scrol we meet with. His Examples will be brought out of such Books as have Dates to testify when they were written: At least, some of these he endeavours to find out for every Age.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Oxford</hi>-Catalogue of <hi>MSS.</hi> come early enough to my hand it would have led me to a new store of Pedigrees, Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Inquisitions, Letters, &amp;c. among <hi>Mr. Dodesworth</hi>'s, <hi>Mr. Wood's</hi> and Sir <hi>William Glynne</hi>'s
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:94637:15"/> Books; to several Papers of State, relating to the Affairs of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, in my Lord <hi>Longueville</hi>'s and <hi>Mr. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi>'s Libraries; to the History of the Naval Force of <hi>England,</hi> in her time, in that of <hi>Mr. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pys;</hi> and to a vast Number of Reports, Pleadings and other Law-Tracts, amongst the many choice Volumes of the Learned Bishop of <hi>Norwich:</hi> But I had weary'd my self with Reviews before I had an Opportunity of looking into that excellent Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and therefore I must e'en desire the Reader to make those Additions himself. Nor shall I now trouble him with any of the Defects in the Second Part; since those that have been observ'd to me are neither very many, nor of any great Weight.
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:94637:15"/> Some Objections indeed have been rais'd against particular Characters of Authors and their Writings; wherein those that are concern'd, either for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or their Friends, accuse me of being too rigorous and even <hi>Ʋnjust</hi> in my Censures. I may probably live to see another E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Work: And then, if these Gentlemen shall convince me of the Truth of what they alledge, I hope I shall abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfy them that I was not under the Influence of any little sneaking Designs, in Flattering Men in Power or Contemning those that are in Affliction. Till this is done, I must answer them in the words of an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Person, and one that has well consider'd our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Ways of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:94637:16"/>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <hi>Men's Principles, Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Relishes, are so different that it is hard to find a Book which pleases or displeases all Men.</hi> Those very Passages wherewith some are highly Scandaliz'd, are as much applauded by others; and these different and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Opinions come from such Judges as I truely and equally honour: But they must give me leave to affirm that I was as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byass'd and disinterested in write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are in sentenceing; and that I must adhere to my own thoughts, till I see better Reasons (than hitherto have been offer'd) to recede from them.

<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:94637:16"/> The first Draught of this <hi>Historical Library</hi> was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purely for my own Use; it was afterwards drawn up into something of Form for my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; and 'tis now Publish'd, in hopes of its being Serviceable to other Lovers of our <hi>English</hi> Histories and Antiquities. If it fails of this good End, and brings upon its Author the displeasure of some of those he design'd to oblige, 'tis not the first time that he has been thus mistaken in his Measures: And he has reason to thank God that his Constitution is of that hardy Frame, that an unlook'd for Frown (where he hoped for a smoother Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance) will not break his heart, nor deter him from <hi>continuing in</hi> what he thinks to be <hi>well-doing.</hi>

               <p>THE Society of Antiquaries (projected by Sir <hi>Robert Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</note> and others) took particular care to make this one of the Rules and<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid. D. <hi>Th.

Par. 3.</note> Statutes of their Community, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of our Kings and Queens should be exactly (because of the scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Copies) enquir'd after, and preserv'd in their Library. And 'twas certainly a right Thought in them; since 'tis but a lame Account that our Historians commonly give us of such Matters. They may possibly take notice of something Commanded,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94637:18"/> or Prohibited, in this or that Year, by Royal Authority; but they seldom give us the Reasons whereon such pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Edicts were built: And yet these (which are always express'd in the formal Instrument it self) are best worth knowing, and have usually couch'd in them the chief part of the Story of those times. It was once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by<note n="(a)" place="bottom">St. 31 Hen. 8. cap. 8.</note> Act of Parliament, that all <hi>Proclamations made by the King's Highness, with the Advice of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable [Privy] Council, should be obey'd and kept, as though they were made by Act of Parliament:</hi> But this, being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards judg'd to be of a terrible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, was presently repeal'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother subsequent<note n="(b)" place="bottom">1 Ed. 6. cap. 12.</note> Law.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94637:18"/> and are therefore particularly Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd here as well as elsewhere; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it amiss, to consider them in this Chapter.

In the first Years of that King, the Style was chang'd; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of them ran in this Form, <hi>In cujus rei Testimonium has Literas nostras fieri fecimus patentes: Teste meipso.</hi> To distinguish those that are truly Antient and Genuine, from such as are false and Counterfeit, it will be requisite that one be perfectly well skill'd in the several Changes that have been made by our Kings in their Seals and Titles. None of 'em seal'd with any<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Id. par. 1 cap. 1.7. a. b.</note> Seal of Arms before <hi>Richard</hi> the First; the Seals of his Predecessors bearing only the Pourtraicture of the King, sitting in a Chair on one side, and on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back on the other.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94637:19"/>
                  <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> the Duke whereof bore one Lyon) was the first that seal'd with three; and all our succeeding Kings have follow'd his Example. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in the thirteenth Year of his Reign, Quarter'd the Arms of <hi>France</hi> with his three Lyons; and this Copy has been also carefully written after by all his Successors.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94637:29"/> Discourse of the Uniformity of the Government of <hi>England,</hi> will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to consider that Author apart from the rest. There are several Witty, Political and Moral, Reflections in his Book; which discover a peculiar Art in drawing very notable and weighty Conclusions from weak and Airy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. His Remarks on the Clergy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions, are so full of Bitterness and Invective, as might have become Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himself, and are an evident Argument of the Author's having a mind to Ape even the very Passions of that angry Great Man. Some favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Expressions towards Monarchy drop from him unawares; as when he speaks of the Duke of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>'s being a scourge to the People for their <hi>Causeless deserting of the Royal Stem,</hi> &amp;c. But, whenever this happens, he's manifestly out of his way. His main design was to blacken all our Kings, and to shew that they had nothing lovely in them but what was deriv'd from the Favour and Caresses of the People, as will appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abstract of the whole Work, which shall be given in his own Words. <hi>The</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94637:29"/> British <hi>People held the Helm of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their own Hands, till the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>made them a Province, and subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them to Kings. The</hi> Saxons <hi>were also a Free People, and a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: saving only that these, as well as the</hi> Britains, <hi>paid a profound Respect and Reverence to their Priests. The</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror <hi>stoop'd under the Law of a</hi> Saxon <hi>King, and became a King by Leave, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreseeing, that a Title gotten by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is more certain than that which is gotten by Power.</hi> William Rufus <hi>was happy in the fear or favour of the People; for he had nothing else to make room for his rising.</hi> Henry <hi>the First bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by Capitulation, to be Just, that he might be Great; and the People to submit to Justice, that they might be Free. K.</hi> Stephen <hi>was a Vapour mounted up by the Clergy; toss'd by Tempests for a time, and at length falling.</hi> Henry <hi>the Second's Title was by Compact made between the Lords, King</hi> Stephen, <hi>and himself; all being then ready to try the Right by the Sword to that to which none of them had any right at all (at that time) but by the favour of the People.</hi> Richard <hi>the First</hi>'s <hi>Entrance was upon an Election made in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94637:30"/> his Father's time.</hi> John <hi>was chosen hand over head, and so ruled: though the King must be thought sober, the Man was mad.</hi> Henry <hi>the Third was the first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of Conscience, in point of Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Inheritance; the People closing about this Spark, in hopes it might bring forth a flame whereby to warm themselves in stormy weather.</hi> Edward <hi>the first conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Arbitrary Power in</hi> England: <hi>But our good old Enemies (the</hi> Scots) <hi>by Divine Providence suddenly cross'd his way.</hi> Edward <hi>the Second was made a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of God's Revenge upon inordinate Desires in a King, and of the</hi> English <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enraged: Not long surviving his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, he dy'd a Death meet to be for ever blotted out of the thoughts of all Subjects, but to he had in everlasting remembrance of all Kings.</hi> Edward <hi>the third, after fifty years Reign, dy'd in his Minority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rule of a Woman of none of the best Fame.</hi> Richard <hi>the Second retain'd a tincture of the light Inconstancy of his Mother, and the Luxuriousness of his great Grandfather; and, running his</hi> [Ed. II's] <hi>Course, came to his End.</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>the fourth was an unhappy confident Man, that durst undertake more than he would, did more than he ought, and was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94637:30"/> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful in what he did; yet never attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his End, to be sure of his Crown and Quiet of Mind.</hi> Henry <hi>the fifth was bold enough to out-face small Doubts in point of Succession: for he could (for a need) out-face common Civility it self.</hi> Henry <hi>the Sixth enter'd the</hi> Throne <hi>in his Mother's Lap. A sad Presage of what follow'd; for many Men think that he was in a Lap all his Days.</hi> Edward <hi>the fourth came in by the People, though he endeavour'd to support himself by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Dependencies.</hi> Edward <hi>the fifth was the</hi> Materia Prima <hi>of a King; and liv'd only long enough to be enroll'd amongst the rest.</hi> Richard <hi>the third proceeded from a Protector to an Ʋsurper, and thence to a Tyrant; a Scourge to the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, especially the Nobility; an Instrument of God's Revenge upon himself; a Man made up of Clay and Blood; living not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and dying unlamented.</hi> Henry <hi>the Seventh was a Cunning Man, rather than a Wise</hi> English <hi>King. And, though he dy'd Rich, yet is he since grown into Debt to the Penmen of his Story, that by their own Excellency have render'd him a better King than he was.</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth knew neither faithful Servant, Counsellor nor Wife; but struck at all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94637:31"/> that stood in his way.</hi> Edward <hi>the Sixth was every way tender; born and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by extraordinary Means, which could never make his Days many, or his Reign long. Q.</hi> Mary <hi>liv'd an uncomfortable Life; shaped a bloody Reign, and had but a dim Conclusion. Q</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in a heat against</hi> Rome; <hi>wherein also she was born and train'd up by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Brother's Order, and saw enough in his Sister's Course to confirm her therein.</hi> This is the Summ and Substance of this admir'd Book; which (with its Author) I shall leave to the Reader's due corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and proceed.</p>

For Instance, The Statute<note n="(b)" place="bottom">37. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cap. 9.</note> of Felony for Stealing a Falcon (in the last Editions) has the words <hi>Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, or any other Hawk;</hi> and some Old Copies in Manuscript have <hi>Lanyret, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor ou autor Falcon:</hi> Whereas the true Reading is, that of the Eldest Prints, <hi>Lanyret ou auter Falcon;</hi> omitting the the Word <hi>Austor</hi> (or Gos-hawk) which the Enactors of that Law never thought of, and not using so general a Term as any <hi>other Hawk,</hi> which likewise goes beyond their Intention.

Several of the Constitutions of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third (as <hi>De Anno Bissextili, Assisa Panis,</hi> &amp;c.) are jumbled and misplaced, so as to follow after others of <hi>Edward</hi> the First's Enacting; and several of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's (<hi>De Prerogativa Regis,</hi> and <hi>Modus faciendi Hominium</hi>) are likewise follow'd by some of that King's Fathers and Grandfathers. The putting of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94637:38"/> Marginal Notes to the Statutes at large, was first begun by <hi>Will.

Ibid. 1618.</note> afterwards gave the same more serviceably (with good useful Marginal Notes) down to the Sixteenth of K. <hi>James</hi> the First. These have since been continu'd by <hi>Manby, Keeble,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Pulton</hi>'s comparing of the Statutes of the first ten Kings, (from the Ninth Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, to the Second of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third) with the Original Records in <hi>Latine,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> his examining of the rest, his References, Abstracts of private Acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Performances which have highly obliged the Publick; but are still ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of farther Improvements than our late Publishers have thought fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on them. In comparing these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with the MS. Rolls of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, we may observe, 1. Divers Acts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94637:39"/> in Print that are not in the Roll. 2. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Rolls never yet Printed. 3. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Clauses omitted in the Print, which occur in the Rolls. 4. Many consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Variations; especially in qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bitter Reflections on the Pope's U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpations. 5. Some Statutes preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be Enacted, and afterwatds dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affirm'd, and yet Printed. 6. Whole Parliaments omitted, wherein were many notable Matters Transacted. 7. Whole Parliaments Repeal'd and made void by Subsequents.

The common placing of our Statute Laws is certainly of great and necessary Use; especially since they grew up to that vast bulk wherein we now have them. But when these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical Abstracts are publish'd, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that a more than ordinary care be taken in examining the Numeral Quotations, and short References; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the Mistakes, into which the Reader may be led, are unspeakable
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94637:39"/> and endless. The first<note n="(a)" place="bottom">4<seg rend="sup">o</seg>. <hi>Lond.</hi> by <hi>Chr.

He was follow'd and enlarg'd by <hi>Edm. Wingate;</hi> whose Book has been often very carelesly Reprinted. In the last Impression<note n="(b)" place="bottom">8<seg rend="sup">o</seg>. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1689.</note> the false References are said to be rectify'd; and the whole so accurately revis'd, that there's no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a Man's being misled and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on.</p>
               <p>Our Printed Laws, it appears,<note place="margin">Rolls of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> will not afford an Historian full satisfaction in the Particulars they treat on; and therefore Truth as well as Curiosity will necessarily invite him to consult the Original Records, whereof these are often very faulty Copies. Before the use of Printing, and till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, our Statutes were all engross'd in Parchment, and (by vertue of the King's Writ to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) proclaim'd openly in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94637:40"/> A Method which was undoubtedly of excellent Advantage to the Subject, and what fome of our<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Instit.

About the time that this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was offer'd, 'twas<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Instit. par. 1. Lib 2. cap. 10.</note> observ'd, that we had then had near three hundred Sessions of Parliament since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, in each whereof divers Acts had been pass'd; and that of these a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Number had never yet appear'd in Print. The Reader's Zeal will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be the better quicken'd, if we give him one or two of the many Instances that might be afforded him in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Know therefore, that there is<note n="(c)" place="bottom">18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</note> one dormant Statute of this kind, wherein such Ecclesiastical Livings as paid Tenths to the Pope, were exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from paying them to the King; with a Proviso, that the acquir'd Possessions afterwards should be chargeable to the King, and not to the Pope. There's<note n="(d)" place="bottom">11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.</note> another Act in the Rolls against Corruption in Judges and other of the King's Officers; which was omitted by those that made Collections for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,

                  <hi>Will. Prynne;</hi> who, in his Preface, gives an Account how
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94637:41"/> most of those that were elder than the Times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, came to be lost. Some few, he says, he did meet with of an elder Date; which seem'd to have been overlook'd by that great Man, whose Work he here sends abroad with some Garnishings (as an <hi>Index,</hi> Marginal Notes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) of his own. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those that are thus omitted, he reckons the Rolls of the 5. 8. 9. and 19th Years of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second; the Statute-Roll of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the First and Second; a Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Book of some Pleas in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during the Reigns of the two first <hi>Edwards;</hi> and lastly, a few Bundles of Petitions in the Parliaments of the Sixth Years of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, and the four first Years of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. He informs us likewise, that in the Clause, Patent, Charter and Fine, Rolls of King <hi>John, Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>Edward</hi> the First and Second, he found some Writs of Summons; together with several short Memorials of Acts and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Aids, Subsidies, Dismes and Quindismes, granted in the Parliaments of those Reigns. The Rolls themselves, whence these Abstracts were taken, are now quite perish'd and gone: Which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94637:41"/> he probably supposes to have happen'd either through the negligence of those that were entrusted with the keeping of the Records, or the Iniquity of the Times, during the long continuance of our Civil Wars betwixt the King and Barons, and (afterwards) between the two Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster.</hi> In these Confusions it was natural for the prevailing Parties, by themselves or their Agents, to suppress or embezle all such Records as made against their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Titles and Interests; and the great Liberty, he thinks, that has been since taken by the King's Attourneys, and other Officers, in calling for the Remains of such a Spoil, (without a due care of returning them, when their Occasions were answer'd) has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly encreas'd the Damage The best and only supply, he observes, which is now to be had of these Defects, is from such Fragments as are to be found in our later Records and antient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians; especially in <hi>M. Paris, Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Malmesbury, Huntingdon,</hi> and <hi>Hoveden,</hi> who frequently Register the Parliamentary Proceedings and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions within the several Limits of their Histories.

                  </note> Dr. <hi>Fuller;</hi> saving only that this latter Manuscript (which is also said to be in the Exchequer) is of a more general Extent.

Thus runs the Letter directed to the Sheriff of <hi>Glocester,</hi> which our Author exemplifies at large; and he farther tells us, that it appears, from some passages in the Book, that this Survey was not compleated till twenty years after the Date of these Writs. Here's a Story so like that we have already had of the Conqueror, in all its Parts and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that it would tempt a Man to look for a Counterpart of <hi>Domesday;</hi> and to hope that King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, being taken two hundred years later, would prove the nobler Piece of the two. But I am much afraid that these <hi>Nomina Villarum</hi> are little better than an empty sound; since I have not met with any other Writer that has magnify'd this Relique at the Doctor's Rate.</p>

Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were so many, that it was no easie task to compile a genuine Text out of any, or all of 'em. Some learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons had loaded their Books with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Notes, and some with interlineary Remarks; which, by the carelessness of Transcribers, were afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as part of the Author's own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. It was hard for one Man to struggle with these Difficulties, and to be so perfect a Master of <hi>Bracton</hi>'s Style, as always to distinguish what was truly of his own Composure, from what was only (through Ignorance, or Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency) father'd on him; and therefore many worthy Professors of the Law gave their Assistance towards the setting forward and finishing so desirable a Work. By their kind clubbing of their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94637:87"/> Pains and Parts, this truly venerable <hi>Code</hi> of our antient Common-Law was publish'd in as correct a manner as was possible; and has ever since had an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem answerable to its real Deserts and Value. It consists of five Books; which begin with the several legal ways of procuring of Properties; and proceed to those of the just maintaining or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of them. The Method is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and very conformable to that of the great Emperor <hi>Justinian;</hi> whose Matter is also very frequently adhered to, and his Laws quoted (sometimes <hi>in ipsissimis verbis</hi>) as familiarly as if they were part of the known Common-Law of this Kingdom. On every Head we have an interspers'd Register of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Writs, and Reports of adjudg'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in both Benches; as also of such as have been try'd before the Judges <hi>in Eyre, Assize,</hi> &amp;c. The Author must be pardon'd his easie Admission of the Pope's Supremacy, and his sometimes Naturalizing the Canon as well as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-Law, when we consider the time wherein he wrote: That it was soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter King <hi>John</hi> had made a formal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of his Realm to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and when the greatest part of <hi>Europe</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:94637:88"/> was entirely under its usurp'd Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Passages that savour strong of the Iniquity and Vassalage of those unhappy Days are not many; and there is that disagreeable Obliquity in them; from the other continu'd Description of our true <hi>English</hi> Government, that they are readily discern'd to be preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and Monstrous.

               <p>Once more, we are to return to our Shades: For who was the Author of that Methodical and learned Treatise which bears the Name of <hi>Fleta</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fleta.</note> is not known, nor indeed hardly so much as guess'd at. 'Tis plain, that he wrote in the Reign of King <hi>Edward,</hi> of whom he says many mighty things in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: But which of our first three <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:94637:88"/> he means, will admit of some Dispute. There's one Passage in the<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. 1. cap. 20. Sect. 59.</note> Book, which seems to intimate, that he wrote either in the days of the Second or Third: <hi>Qui receperint debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Regis, vel partem debiti, &amp; debita illa non acquietaverint tam de tempore Regis</hi> E. <hi>Patris Regis, quàm de tempore praesenti.</hi> Thus our Printed Books, in both Editions, give the Words; and herein they are acknowledg'd to agree with the Manuscript from which they were publish'd. But even that Copy it self is full of Literal Faults; and is suppos'd (by several Blanks in it, left for Words, and sometimes whole Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences) to have been taken by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skillful Scribe, and a good while after the Author's own Time. It's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not improbable that the Transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mistook <hi>E.</hi> for <hi>H;</hi> or else, that, writing his Copy in one of the two latter Reigns, and being over-wise, he took upon him to vary the Story, so as to suit his own Days: For 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that such a Writer, in either of the two suppos'd Reigns, should overlook
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94637:89"/> the many Famous Statutes that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted by those Kings, and would have been so much to his purpose on several occasions.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94637:90"/> probable some of 'em might be sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In his first Book he insists chiefly upon Pleas of the Crown; in the second he gives a most full and curious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the Officers of the King's Houshold, with many other Particulars that exceedingly illustrate the Story of those Times; and in the Four following he shews the then Practice of our Courts of Judicature, the Forms of Writs, Explication of Law-Terms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He sometimes transcribes the very words of <hi>Bracton;</hi> and elsewhere jumps with (one of <hi>Bracton</hi>'s Epitomizers) <hi>Gilbert de Thornton.</hi> There's one peice of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story in his Book, which will want the Authority of some others to support it 'Tis the Account which it gives<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. 3. cap. 6.

               <p>THE Miseries of our many Civil Wars must be presumed to have destroy'd vast Numbers of Papers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateing to the Affairs of private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as well as more Public Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords; especially when we consider the Several Forfeitures and Sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to which (at some time or other) all that are of any Note have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. But the suddain Subversion of Monasteries; together with the Havock that it made of Registries of a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Nature, did also occasion a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Destruction of these useful Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for History; since many of the most considerable <hi>English</hi> Families had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their best<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vid.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94637:137"/> in the Times of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and that there was hardly so much of the Mystery here, before their Arrival, as would serve to settle the Affairs of a Private Family, much less to adjust the concerns of the Kingdom. In these <hi>Expensa Domûs</hi> we may (with great Pleasure and Advantage) see how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent the rates of Corn, Castle, Wool, Leather, &amp;c. were in several Ages: And this will not only furnish us with a tolerable Conjecture at the Humours of the Men of those times, but also pretty well enable us to calculate the Gradual Improvements that have been made in our Trade and Manufactures, or what we call the <hi>State of the Nation.</hi> The Wages of Servants and other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers is what is most especially to be noted; since the Prices of all other things have been rightly<note n="(a)" place="bottom">See <hi>R.

The Rents of Farms, by the yearly Improvements of the Lands, are so changeable and uncertain, that hardly any proper Judgment can be made of the value or Scarcity of Coin in the Nation by any Estimate taken thence: But House-Rents will afford a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bottom for Calculation; especially in such Places where the Concourse and Throng of the Inhabitants has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd almost the same for several Ages. Thus, for example, when we find a large House within the very Precincts of the Court, in Channon-Row in <hi>Westminster,</hi> letten to no less a Person than the Comptroller of the King's Houshold for Thirty Shillings, we must conclude that (in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, when<note n="(c)" place="bottom">J.

Few or none are our <hi>English</hi> Writers that have hitherto attempted a full History of our Coins. Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> gave us the Cuts of several of 'em, curiously enough design'd, in his general Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: But, as we shall have occasion to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94637:141"/> observe anon, he took them upon the Credit of Sir <hi>R. Cotton</hi>'s and <hi>Mr. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s Conjectures; and therefore has not always appropriated them to their right owners. Sir <hi>H.

Others have lately consider'd the same Affair with much skill and exactness: But their Speculations, being of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Extent, and applicable to almost all Nations and Climates, are not to our Purpose.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94637:143"/> for the new coining of the money of this Kingdom, and raising its value: To which end he gives his Majesty an Account of the Weight, Metal, Form, &amp;c. of all the then current Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in <hi>Europe;</hi> with Draughts of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Piece, in Black and White.

               <p>Before the Reign of King Charles the First, we have very few Pieces,<note place="margin">Medals.</note> (as <hi>Mr. Evelyn</hi> observes) that can pretend to the Name of Medal. The most of those few, he has given us; and I shall not repeat them, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Reader to his Book. One or two there are, within my Limits, which seem not to have fallen in the way of that most curious Gentleman. If <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's Rose-Noble (or <hi>Golden Royal,</hi> as he calls it) be indeed to be reckon'd amongst our Medals, yet it must not pretend to be
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94637:144"/> the first of that Name; if all be true which a modern<note n="(a)" place="bottom">See J. <hi>Barnes</hi>'s Hist. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. pag. 4.</note> Author has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded about the Coronation-Pieces of that great King. He is extremely Particular in his Description of these: Telling us that <hi>on the Pile was the young Prince crown'd, laying a Scepter on a Heap of Hearts, with this Motto</hi> POPU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LO DAT JURA VOLENTI. <hi>On the Reverse a hand held forth, as it were saving a Crown falling from on high, with those words</hi> NON RAPIT SED RECIPIT. I do not doubt but his Friend at <hi>Greys-Inn</hi> had such a Medal: But he must give me leave to suspect that they were very widely mistaken that first ascrib'd it to this Prince. For (to omit other Reasons) there's nothing in the Legend that look's that way; and the inscrib'd fancies are too brisk for those Times, savouring of a much more Polite Age. One of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth's</hi> is omitted, whereon we have the Queen's Head crown'd, with the Legend <hi>QƲID NOS SINE TE;</hi> and on the Reverse, a Castle mounted on a Globe inscrib'd, <hi>QƲID HOC SINE
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94637:144"/> ARMIS.</hi> Another of the same Queen is also wanting, which bears four Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures (a Man, Woman, and two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) in a Praying Posture, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd 1588. The Legend being <hi>HOMO PROPONIT, DEƲS DISPONIT.</hi> On the Reverse is a great Ship toss'd on the Waves, and <hi>HISPANI FƲGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ƲNT ET PEREƲNT NEMINE SEQƲENTE.</hi> These are all that (as far as I know) were struck before the union of the Kingdoms in King <hi>James</hi> the First, which have escaped the notice of this worthy Person. I shall only beg leave to add this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Remark, that perhaps the Reverse of his first Medalion of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth is rather to be reckon'd a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Badge than regardant of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Action of that King: Since his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has the Portcluse, with the same Motto, on his Tomb at <hi>Westminster;</hi> which there seems to refer to his other Titles to the Crown being strengthen'd by his Mother's being a <hi>Beaufort,</hi> of which Family the Portcluse was the Badge. And, what if this very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalion be indeed one of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's; and unduely (by some Errour of the Engraver or Copyer)
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94637:145"/> bestow'd on his Son? The Figure of the Face would tempt a man to suspect some such matter.</p>

                  <hi>de Lis,</hi> and two Labels of Pearl (or some such thing) at each ear: But several of the rest differ considerably in this particular, as will be noted of each in their Order. And, where no assistance can be had from the variety of their Crowns, we may be pretty well enabled to Tribe them right by the change of their Style and Title; whereof enough has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said, upon the Subject of their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Where this expedient likewise
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94637:148"/> fails us, we are Scrupulously to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the different Allays of the Metal it self: And (lastly) the difference of the Size is sometimes carefully to be heeded. For example, amongst the three first <hi>Henries</hi> we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thin Pieces of about the Weight, Breadth, and Intrinsick value, of a Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Three pence; which was their Penny, and from which was still retain the Name of our <hi>Penny-weight.</hi> In succeeding Reigns larger Peices, of four times the bulk and weight of these, were minted; they, from such increase of their Size beyond that of former times, were call'd <hi>Groats,</hi> and weigh'd as much as our present Shillings.</p>

Nor was <hi>Calice</hi> the only Mint in this King's Reign; since it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he had Groats coin'd (not only at <hi>London,</hi> but also) at <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Bristol.</hi> Some of these are in <hi>Mr. Thoresby</hi>'s Cabinet; and they have the Initial Letters <hi>E</hi> and <hi>B</hi> on the King's Breast, as well as the names of those respective Cities more at large on their Reverses. The same Author produces a Record, whereby the unfortunate Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> is appointed Master of the King's Mints in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and he seems yet farther to have enhans'd the value of all the Pieces both of Gold and Silver. Out of a pound weight of Gold he coin'd fifty Nobles of Eight Shillings and four pence; the Gold being (as at this day) twenty-three Carats, three grains and half, fine: And of a pound of Silver
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94637:163"/> (as <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth had done before) he made a hundred and twelve Groats and a half. So that now the Groat weigh'd about six pence of our present Money; which is hardly half of what it did in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. This, well consider'd, may perhaps convince us that <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's Groats are no such Rarities as some have imagin'd: And 'twere indeed strange if they should be so, since we are sure this King coin'd a very great deal of Money. We have plenty of two Sorts of old <hi>Edward-Groats;</hi> which differ much in their Weight, Bulk and Insrciption.

The last of these has been thought to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Duck or Drake; and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Tradition is that these Shillings were struck (Medal-wise) in memory of the famous Expedition of Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Drake,</hi> which was finish'd in her twenty-second year.

Some of her lesser Coins had <hi>Civitas London</hi> on the Reverse; instead of the common <hi>Posui Deum</hi> &amp;c. on the larger. She caus'd indeed some <hi>Irish</hi> Shillings (call'd <hi>Harpers,</hi> from the Arms of that Kingdom stamp'd upon them) to be made of a baser kind than the <hi>English,</hi> so that they usually pass'd for Nine-pence here: And towards the latter end of her Reign, she paid her Army there with yet much baser Coin; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three<note n="(a)" place="bottom">F. <hi>Moryson</hi>'s Itin.

This our Goldsmith's valu'd at no more than Twopence-halfpenny, tho' 'twas commanded by Proclamation to pass at twelvepence in that Kingdom; design'd for the speedy impoverishment and reduction of the Rebels there.

The former sort had <hi>A Domino factum est istud &amp; est Mirabile</hi> on their Reverse; and the latter <hi>Scutum fidei protegit eam.</hi> The Indentures of that year (those, at least, that <hi>Mr. Lowndes</hi> met with) do not mention the Pieces of Angels and a half, nor three Angels; but they reckon also, what my Author omits, her Quarter-Angels at Two Shillings and Sixpence.
